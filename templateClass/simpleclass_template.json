"Prepare a simple BOOPSI class, just inheriting modelclass, with just one Attrib. send update events, and can be modifed by changing attribs.\nThe same code will compile an external .class binary that will be shared by intuition, with a separated test executable using it,\nbut also a single test executable that links statically the same test and the same class, keeping it private.\n\n You should develop with the static project which is easy to debug, and when done eventually publish the shared .class version.\n Also, to update shared binaries, quit all uses, then type \"Avail flush\", or previous version will stay in memory.",
